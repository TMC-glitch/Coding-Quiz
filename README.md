# Coding Quiz

## User Story

As a boot camp student I want to take a timed quiz on Javascript fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- When I take the code quiz, pressing the start button starts the timer and presents the first question of the quiz.
- Incorrect answers will result in a loss of 10 seconds from the clock.
- Quiz will end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
- When the quiz is over user can enter and save initials and score to local storage.
